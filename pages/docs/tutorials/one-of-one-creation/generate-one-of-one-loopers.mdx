# Generate 1/1 Loopers

## Overview

This guide outlines the steps to generate 1/1 Loopers that include their PFPs (Profile Picture), sprite sheets, and metadata from sprite sheets. This process can be particularly useful when you have an array of sprite sheets with different traits.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ“˜">
Important: Make sure to verify the authenticity of your sprite sheets and metadata before committing. Incorrect or corrupt data can result in unusable or misleading Loopers.

## Requirements ðŸ“‹

- Maize Software: Make sure it's [downloaded](../download-maize) and [setup](../setup-maize) correctly.
- Owning a [Maize Premium Access](https://loopexchange.art/collection/maize-access/item/0x6692d7a147762ce9335746c7b062576ef9834500f5546a29c724c55752f668c7)
- Individual sprite sheets that are 160 x 288.
- Folders and files [setup](generate-one-of-one-loopers#folder-and-file-setup)

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Initiate `Generate 1/1 Loopers` 
    Navigate to the 1/1 Creation Section within the Maize Menu. Here, you'll find the Generate 1/1 Loopers option. Click on it to start.
    
  ### Input all information
  Populate the NFT Name, NFT Description, Collection Address, Royalty Percentage, Iterations, and Input Directory. The chart below provides additional information on each.

| Field | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| NFT Name | Base name for the NFTs | Alpha CobLoopers |
| NFT Description | Description for each NFT | Alpha CobLoopers provide acces to Alpha Fields! |
| Collection Address | Blockchain Address for the collection | 0xa6a1de23cfe7a2cbd9d3c63d53efd263426bc8ed |
| Royalty Percentage | Percentage of royalties on sales (1-5%) | 5 |
| Iterations | Number of 1/1s to create | 10 |
| Input Directory | Sprite's folder location | C:\cobmin\LL_Ready |

    ### Process the sprites
Once all information has been populated click the `Process` button.

  ### Review the Results
  Upon completion, the application will automatically open the generated folder with the iterations. Review content to ensure everything is as intended. Feel free to change the metadata as needed.

  ### Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
You have successfully generated 1/1 Loopers for Looper Lands. Well done!

## Folder and File Setup

The organization of folders and file names dictates how sprites are stacked, what data is included in metadata, and the maximum allowable percentage of each sprite, if applicable.

FYI: Anywhere an underscore is used a space will replace it when necessary.
</Callout>

### Main Folder structure

In your base directory, you should create folders that are prefixed with a number followed by an underscore (e.g., 0_background, 2_clothes). The purpose and contents of these folders are elaborated below.

The application selects a random sprite from each folder and stacks them in ascending order, starting with the folder prefixed 0.

### Metadata File Structure
Both the folder names and file names inform the properties and attributes of metadata. While the discussion below focuses on properties, the same principles apply to attributes.

#### Basic

In a straightforward setup, the folder name acts as the metadata Key, while the file name becomes its corresponding Value. For instance, in a folder named 0_background, a file named greenlight.png would result in a metadata key-value pair of "Background: GreenLight."

#### Advanced Folder Naming
When you need to select either one or multiple sprites from a set, use an ampersand (&) at the end of folder names that are meant to be considered together. For example, a folder named 2_clothes could contain a folder named outfit, clothes_top&, and clothes_bottom&. In this instance either 1 outfit will be chosen or 1 clothes top and 1 clothes bottom.

The metadata will not show clothes in this instance but outfit or clothes bottom and clothes top as the Key(s) with the respective file name inside as the Value.

#### Advanced File Naming
File names can also carry special symbols to influence sprite selection, expand metadata, or control their maximum occurrence percentage.

##### Maximum Occurrence
To set a maximum occurrence percentage for a sprite, prepend the file name with X#N, where N is the maximum percentage allowed. For example, X#5_SunsetRoseBlush.png will appear in no more than 5% of the iterations.

##### Metadata Expansion
File names can also include additional metadata using the - and + symbols. For example, the file Bob-Hair_Color+Black.png will result in two metadata entries: one for "Hairstyle: Bob" and another for "Hair Color: Black."
