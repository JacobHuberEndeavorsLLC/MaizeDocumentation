# Setup Maize

## Overview

This guide will help you setup Maize and connect to Loopring. There are two networks to configure your wallet to: Ethereum Mainnet and Ethereum Testnet (Goerli).

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have an active [Loopring account](https://loopring.io/#/trade/lite/LRC-ETH). 
    - For full functionality, use a GameStop or MetaMask wallet. While the Loopring wallet will work, please note that transfers are currently not supported.
- Maize [downloaded](download-maize) to your computer.

   Use a newer wallet to be safe. Don't reveal the private keys of a wallet with significant value!
   </Callout>

## Steps

    ### Open mainnetappsettings.json
    In your Maize folder step into Input > Environment and open the mainnetappsettings file. Set this file aside for [step 4](setup-maize#find-layer-1-key) and [step 5](setup-maize#replace-the-remaining-values).

    **Warning: Protect Your API Keys!**

    Do not share your API keys with anyone. API keys grant access to sensitive data and operations. Keep them confidential and never expose them publicly or in any communication, including screenshots or code samples.

    Below I will be demonstrating with a burner wallet.

    Under Avatar > Security click Export Account and sign the transaction to view your Loopring information.

    - choose üíé mainnet and click ‚úîÔ∏è

    ### Finish
    If you see the Maize Menu with all of its functionalities then you have successfully setup Maize on the Ethereum Mainnet! 
    
    To setup Maize on the Ethereum Testnet (Goerli), follow the same steps but be sure to connect to Goerli in your wallet.  

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting
### Windows protected your PC
When first launching the application you might run into the screen 'Windows protected your PC'. To get past this click More Info > Run anyway.

### Please verify appsettings.json is correct
After trying to connect to Maize you might recieve the below screen. If you recieve this screen then please double or triple check that your values are correct in your main/testnetappsettings.json file.
