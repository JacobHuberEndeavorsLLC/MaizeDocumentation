    ## Troubleshooting
    #### Unable to run Maize

    MacOS users need to run a command in *Terminal* to turn the file into an executable before being able to run the tool.

    To do this, you need to open *Terminal* > move to the location where the `Maize` file is located > then run the command `chmod +x Maize`

    ##### Example

    Since the `Maize` file is saved in *Documents* for this example, we would: 

    open *Terminal* > type `cd Documents/Maize` > press Enter > type `chmod +x Maize` > press Enter

    ![Maize Folder](/images/tutorials/downloadMaize/chmod.jpg)

    Once you hit enter the second time, the `Maize` file icon will change
