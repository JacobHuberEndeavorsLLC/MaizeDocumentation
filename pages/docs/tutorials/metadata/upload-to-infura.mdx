  - Infura will ask for credit card details, given the potential to exceed the 5 GB free tier. Once entered, press 'CREATE API KEY'.
Your API Key and Secret Key will be visible within your new project. Make a note of them for upcoming steps.

  ### Initiate `Upload to Infura`
  Navigate to the Metadata Section within the Maize Menu. Here, you'll find the Upload to Infura option. Click on it to start.

  ### Embed your Keys
The 'Infurasettings.json' file will pop open. Insert your API Key in place of 'Your_Infura_Api_Key', and your Secret Key for 'Your_Infura_Secret_Key'. Make sure to save the file afterward.

  ### Enter Metadata CIDs
In the provided large textbox, insert your metadata CIDs. Ensure you place each CID on a separate line.
