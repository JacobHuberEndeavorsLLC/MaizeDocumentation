## Overview

This guide outlines the steps to refresh your collection's metadata on Loopring. This process can be particularly useful when an NFT isn't displayed in your wallet or on an explorer.

    - Input both the minter's address and an NFT Id from the collection.
    - After providing the necessary data, press 'Find'. The app will take a moment to process your request.
