## Welcome to Taiko!

Taiko is a decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup ([Type 1 ZK-EVM](https://mirror.xyz/labs.taiko.eth/w7NSKDeKfJoEy0p89I9feixKfdK-20JgWF9HZzxfeBo)). We're working on the full Ethereum [ZK-EVM circuits](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits) as part of a community effort led by the Ethereum Foundation's Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team.

Check out the [Taiko roadmap](/images/roadmaps/taiko-roadmap.png) to see where we're going!
