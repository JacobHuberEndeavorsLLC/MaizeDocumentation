There is a concept of an oracle prover on Taiko, which will be removed when the circuits are complete and some rollup training wheels have been removed (such as DAO governance and multi-proofs). The oracle prover is a prover that is trusted to provide the correct state transition. If oracle proving is enabled, then the oracle prover will be forced as the first prover for a block and the second will be from a prover. The actual prover (one of you) however will receive the reward of course, this is just a safety mechanism we have in place while the ZK-EVM is still in development.
