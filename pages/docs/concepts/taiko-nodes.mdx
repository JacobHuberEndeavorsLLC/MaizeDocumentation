## Overview

Taiko nodes are minimally modified Ethereum execution clients that consist of two parts: `taiko-geth` and `taiko-client`. The two parts communicate with each other through the Engine API.

## Taiko geth

The [taiko-geth](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth) repository is a fork of [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) with some changes made according to the Taiko protocol. In the Taiko network, `taiko-geth` is the `driver` software for the Taiko client.

Like Ethereum mainnet execution engines, `taiko-geth` listens to new L2 transactions broadcasted in the L2 network, executes them in the EVM, and holds the latest state and database of all current L2 data.

## Taiko client

The compiled binary `bin/taiko-client` is the main entrypoint. It includes three sub-commands:

- `driver`: keeps the L2 execution engine's chain in sync with the `TaikoL1` contract by directing the L2 [execution engine](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#execution-client).
- [`proposer`](https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/other-terms#proposer): proposes new transactions from the L2 execution engine's transaction pool to the `TaikoL1` contract.
- [`prover`](https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/other-terms#prover): requests [validity proofs](https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/other-terms#validity-proof) from the [ZK-EVM](https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#zk-evm) and sends transactions to prove the proposed blocks are valid or invalid.

### Driver

Taiko client's `driver` software serves as an L2 consensus client. It listens for new L2 blocks from the Taiko L1 protocol contract, then directs the connected L2 execution engine to insert them into its local chain through the Engine API.

#### Engine API

Taiko client's `driver` directs an L2 execution engine to insert new blocks or reorganize the local chain through the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/src/engine).

#### Chain synchronization process

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
The Taiko protocol allows a block's timestamp to be equal to its parent block's timestamp, which differs from the original Ethereum protocol. So it's fine that there are two `TaikoL1.proposeBlock` transactions included in one L1 block.
</Callout>
  
Taiko client's driver informs the L2 execution engine about Taiko protocol contract's latest verified L2 head and tries to let it catch up with the latest verified L2 block through P2P at first.

The driver monitors the execution engine's sync progress: If it's unable to make any new sync progress in a period of time, the driver switches to inserting the verified blocks into its local chain through the Engine API one by one.

After the L2 execution engine catches up with the latest verified L2 head, the driver subscribes to `TaikoL1.BlockProposed` events. When a new pending block is proposed, the driver:

1. Gets the corresponding `TaikoL1.proposeBlock` L1 transaction.
2. Decodes the `txList` and block metadata from the transaction's calldata.
3. Checks whether the `txList` is valid based on the rules defined in the Taiko protocol.

If the `txList` is **valid**, the driver:

1. Assembles a deterministic `TaikoL2.anchor` transaction based on the rules defined in the protocol and puts it as the first transaction in the proposed `txList`.
2. Uses this `txList` and the decoded block metadata to assemble a deterministic L2 block.
3. Directs the L2 execution engine to insert this assembled block and sets it as the current canonical chain's head via the Engine API.

If the `txList` is **invalid**, the driver:

1. Creates a `TaikoL2.invalidateBlock` transaction and then assembles an L2 block including only this transaction.
2. Directs the L2 execution engine to insert this block, but does not set it as the chain's head via the Engine API.

### Proposer

Taiko client's `proposer` software fetches pending transactions in a L2 execution engine's mempool intervally, then tries to propose them to the Taiko L1 protocol contract.

#### Proposing strategy

Since tokenomics have not been fully implemented in the Taiko protocol, the current proposing strategy is simply based on time interval.

#### Proposing process
To propose a block, the `proposer`:

1. Fetches the pending transactions from the L2 execution engine through the `txpool_content` RPC method.
2. If there are too many pending transactions in the L2 execution engine, splits them into several smaller `txLists`. This is because the Taiko protocol restricts the max size of each proposed `txList`.
3. Commits hashes of the `txLists` by sending `TaikoL1.commitBlock` transactions to L1.
4. Waits for `TaikoData.Config.commitConfirmations` (currently `0`) L1 blocks confirmations.
5. Proposes all splitted `txLists` by sending `TaikoL1.proposeBlock` transactions.

### Prover

#### Proving strategy

Since tokenomics have not been fully implemented in the Taiko protocol, the `prover` software currently proves all proposed blocks.

#### Proving process

When a new block is proposed, the `prover`:

1. Gets the `TaikoL1.proposeBlock` L1 transaction calldata, decodes it, and validates the `txList`, just like what the `driver` software does.
2. Waits until the corresponding block is inserted by the L2 execution engine's `driver` software.
3. Generates a validity proof for that block asynchronously.

If the proposed block has a **valid** `txList`, the `prover`:

1. Generates a Merkle proof of the block's `TaikoL2.anchor` transaction to prove its existence in the `block.txRoot`'s [MPT](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/) and this transaction receipt's [Merkle proof](https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/other-terms#merkle-proofs) in the `block.receiptRoot`'s MPT from the L2 execution engine.
2. Submits the `TaikoL2.anchor` transaction's RLP encoded bytes, its receipt's RLP encoded bytes, the generated Merkle proofs, and a validity proof to prove this block **valid** by sending a `TaikoL1.proveBlock` transaction.

If the proposed block has an **invalid** `txList`, the `prover`:

1. Generates a Merkle proof of the block's `TaikoL2.invalidateBlock` transaction receipt to prove its existence in the `block.receiptRoot`'s MPT from the L2 execution engine.
2. Submits the `TaikoL2.invalidateBlock` transaction receipt's RLP encoded bytes, the generated Merkle proof, and a validity proof to prove this block **invalid**, by sending a `TaikoL1.proveBlockInvalid` transaction.
