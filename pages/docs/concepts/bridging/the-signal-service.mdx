Taiko's signal service is a smart contract available on both L1 and L2, available for any dapp developer to use. It exposes a [really simple interface](/docs/reference/contract-documentation/signal/ISignalService). And it's what uses the previously mentioned merkle proofs to provide a service for secure cross-chain messaging.

You can store signals and check if a signal was sent from an address. It also exposes one more important function: `isSignalReceived`.

What does this function do? The first thing to understand is that the Taiko protocol maintains two important contracts:

- [TaikoL1](/docs/reference/contract-documentation/L1/TaikoL1)
- [TaikoL2](/docs/reference/contract-documentation/L2/TaikoL2)

These contracts both keep track of the block hashes on the **other chain**. So TaikoL1, which is deployed on Ethereum, has access to the latest block hashes on Taiko. And TaikoL2, which is deployed on Taiko, has access to the latest block hashes on Ethereum.

So, `isSignalReceived` can prove on either chain that you sent a signal to the Signal Service on the other chain. A user or dapp can call `eth_getProof`(https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186) which generates a merkle proof.

You need to provide `eth_getProof` with:

1. The signal (the data you want to prove exists within the storage root of some block on the chain)
2. The address of the signal service (the contract address which stores the provided signal)
3. The block number you are asserting the signal was sent on (optional—if you don't provide this, it will default to the latest block number)

And, `eth_getProof` will generate a merkle proof (it will give the necessary sibling hashes and the height of the block, that along with the signal, can rebuild the merkle storage root of the block you are asserting the signal exists in).

This means, assuming that the hashes which TaikoL1 and TaikoL2 maintain are correct, we can reliably send **cross-chain messages**.

Let's walk through an example:

1. First, we can send a message on some source chain, and store it on the signal service.
2. Next, we call `eth_getProof`, which will give us a proof that we did indeed send a message on the source chain.
3. Finally, we call `isSignalReceived` on the destination chain's SignalService which essentially just verifies the merkle proof. `isSignalReceived` will look up the block hash you are asserting you had stored a message on the source chain (where you originally sent the message), and with the sibling hashes inside the merkle proof it will rebuild the merkle root, which verifies the signal was included in that merkle root—meaning it was sent.

And boom! We have sent a cross-chain message. Confusing? Well leave some feedback please if it is, so we can clear it up.
